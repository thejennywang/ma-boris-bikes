===========

Day 1 
Paired with Toan (@yoshdog) today TDD'ing Boris Bikes. We learned about classes, domain models and CRC (Class Responsibility Collaborators) and used them on this project. It was interesting to have to work out what responsiblities belong to certain classes and how they interact with one another. Toan and I were all over the best practices by using branches while functionality was still being developed, committing often, writing meaningful commit messages. Super fun pairing with him!
